    "Certainly! To gracefully end **`test2.py`** when **`test1.py`** completes, you can use a signal or a shared file-based mechanism. Here's an example using a shared file:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shared File Approach**:\n",
    "    - In **`test1.py`**, create a file (e.g., **`stop_signal.txt`**) to signal the termination of **`test2.py`**.\n",
    "    - In **`test2.py`**, continuously check for the existence of this file. If it exists, break out of the loop and exit.\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    **`test1.py`**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import subprocess\n",
    "    import time\n",
    "    import os\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Execute test2.py as a separate process\n",
    "    process = subprocess.Popen([\"python\", \"test2.py\"])\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Rest of the code in test1.py\n",
    "    print(\"Continuing with other tasks...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create the stop signal file when test1.py completes\n",
    "    with open(\"stop_signal.txt\", \"w\") as signal_file:\n",
    "        signal_file.write(\"Stop signal\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Optionally, wait for the subprocess to finish:\n",
    "    process.wait()\n",
    "    print(\"Subprocess completed.\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **`test2.py`**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import os\n",
    "    import time\n",
    "\n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "        # Check if the stop signal file exists\n",
    "        if os.path.exists(\"stop_signal.txt\"):\n",
    "            print(\"Received stop signal. Exiting.\")\n",
    "            break\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Your existing code for recording CPU and memory usage\n",
    "        # ...\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Sleep for some time (adjust as needed)\n",
    "        time.sleep(1)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Signal Approach (Linux/Unix)**:\n",
    "    - In **`test1.py`**, use the `subprocess` module to start **`test2.py`**.\n",
    "    - When **`test1.py`** completes, send a signal (e.g., SIGTERM) to the subprocess.\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    **`test1.py`**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import subprocess\n",
    "    import signal\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Execute test2.py as a separate process\n",
    "    process = subprocess.Popen([\"python\", \"test2.py\"])\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Rest of the code in test1.py\n",
    "    print(\"Continuing with other tasks...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Optionally, wait for the subprocess to finish:\n",
    "    process.wait()\n",
    "    print(\"Subprocess completed.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Send SIGTERM to the subprocess\n",
    "    process.send_signal(signal.SIGTERM)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **`test2.py`**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import time\n",
    "\n",
    "    def signal_handler(signum, frame):\n",
    "        print(\"Received SIGTERM. Exiting.\")\n",
    "        exit()\n",
    "\n",
    "    signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal_handler)\n",
    "\n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "        # Your existing code for recording CPU and memory usage\n",
    "        # ...\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Sleep for some time (adjust as needed)\n",
    "        time.sleep(1)\n",
    "    ```\n",
